Csongor and I headed down to his (and hopefully, one day, my) office at
Imperial. I bullied him into working on his [Unsaturated Type Families][unsat]
proposal, and we spent a good amount of time working through some of the
particularities around their arities and backwards compatibilities.

Afterwards, we worked together on my [Better Custom Type Errors][errors]
proposal --- I am convinced that he and I are the two people in the world with
the most experience in this stuff, likely by an order of magnitude. Csongor
showed me that stuckness is an insufficiently interesting property for the
type errors I'd like to be able to produce, and pointed me towards a richer
vocabulary. Together we significantly improved the scope of the proposal's error
algebra, and are going to change the face of type errors FOREVER.

Also we infiltrated me into the student bar where I illegally bought a beer, and
made sushi promises to his roommate that we couldn't keep. Csongor has made me
promise to come back and hang out more, and I absolutely plan to take him up on
that.
