Justin is a Scala guy, and we spent a lot of time sharing folklore knowledge
from our respective languages. In particular, I wanted to learn about how
Scala's variance system works, and about what their effect system libraries look
like. I was convinced we could write `unsafeCoerce` by abusing Scala's variance
system, but I guess Odersky thought about that because we couldn't make it work.

A while back, Justin bought an Arduino-powered necklace that came with a shitty
C++ coding environment. We couldn't figure out how to build the damn thing, so
decided to just reverse engineer the hardware and Do It Ourselves. After a few
hours of futzing with LED matrices and lots of disgusting bit-twiddling, we
could drive images on it. Success! Take that, shitty C++ environments.

We were also both quite interested in [Unison][unison], decided to download it
and give it a go. Justin found a bug in the fundamental AST-handling machinery
within a few minutes, and I found an unsoundness in their effects system.
Surprisingly productive afternoon, really! All of that being said, Unison is an
amazingly cool language, and I'm excited to give it more love in the near
future.

Hanging out with Justin was a true joy. Not only is he excellent company, but
he's a great story teller, and an exceptional host. He went out of town for a
few days during my visit, and was kind enough to let me stay in his absence. I
considered replacing all of his art with portraits of my face, but it seemed
like too much work. Thanks again for a great time, Justin!
