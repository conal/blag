Meeting Elli was rather unexpected --- she's a friend of my last host, and since
we both had a day to kill, suggested we hang out. We ended up seeing some of
Munich's best tourist traps, destroying our forearms rock-climbing, eating
bad Thai food, and discussing some wild philosophy.

It turns out Elli is teaching herself programming, so I offered to teach her
some Haskell. In my experience, most people leg it and scream in terror after
such a proposition, so I was genuinely surprised when she said yes! Not only
that, but she made remarkable progress after only a few days --- more than I
have seen from a lot of people who *get paid to write Haskell professionally.*
If anyone's looking for a very capable hire, I know someone you should get in
touch with.

Elli was a fantastic host, and her hospitality made it truly difficult to leave
Munich. Thanks Elli, hope to see you again sometime soon!
