Matej and I have been collaborating on Polysemy for several months at this
point, and so it was an absolute delight to get to meet in person. We settled in
to the hostel we were staying at, and after an unsuccessful attempt at getting
creamy garlic soup, we got down to business.

Beforehand, we had made a list of highest-priority things to work on in Polysemy
--- namely reducing the complexity around `Tactics` and `Strategy`, and solving
some issues around locally-introduced effects. We pair programmed on doing the
insane type unification necessary to make the first one happen, and then Matej
graciously answered all my questions about "how the heck is this supposed to
work" for the latter.

All in all, it was a fantastic time. Matej really resonated with me --- I saw a
lot of myself in him, and perhaps unfairly have much higher expectations in him
than I do in myself. Thanks friend!
