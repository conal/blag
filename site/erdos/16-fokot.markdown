Fero and I unfortunately only had a few hours to meet up, but he showed me
around and hooked me up with traditional Slovakian food and excellent company.
We dug into Unison, attempted to write hangman, and immediately found another
couple of bugs. This time it's that characters always compare equal --- meaning
a `Set` will always say "yes" if you ask whether it contains a character. Nice.

I really like the idea of Unison, but dang there are a lot of bugs so far.

Fero is a Scala guy, and walked me through the encoding of typeclasses in Scala.
And jesus christ that thing is a nightmare. I have so much more respect for
Scala guys after that. The sheer amount of hoops they need to go through to get
anything done is astounding.

We did all of this while hanging out on our laptops in a fancy restaurant, much
to the disdain of all of the waiting staff. Sorry yall, but we had important
programming stuff to go over!
