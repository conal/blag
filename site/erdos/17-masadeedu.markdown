My roommate for Haskell eXchange got the plague and spent the entire night
throwing up and almost dying. As a result, I found myself stranded in London
with nowhere to stay for the duration of the conference. Asad had a spare bed
and excessive kindness, and invited me to stay with him after hearing the tale.

The result was some of the most fun I've had yet on my trip. During the
conference, I found myself continuously impressed by *just how much cool shit*
Asad knew, and bullied him into teaching me some of it. On the first night he
walked me through tensors in monoidal categories, and finally convinced me that
monads *really are* just monoids in the monoidal category of endofunctors.

On the second day of the conference, *I* fell down with the plague, and missed
most of it. Asad was cool enough to walk me home (I didn't know the way,) and
keep me company during the hours I was *convinced* that I was going to die. We
had a great time sharing dirty rap songs and just bro-ing out. An absolutely
delightful experience, and I have half a mind to cancel my trip and just go hang
out with Asad full time.
