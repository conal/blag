Welcome to Reasonably Polymorphic, a blog about Haskell, engineering, game
development, mathematics, building tools, and other neat computer science
stuff.
</p>

<p>
Reasonably Polymorphic is the project of <a>Sandy Maguire</a>, who
might be best described somewhere between independent researcher and
voluntarily-unemployed bum. He's known as <strong>isovector</strong>
around the web, and also maintains an <a>experimental lifestyle
  blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in this blog but don't know where to start, here are
excerpts from some of the best posts. Click the title to read more if your toes
are tickled by any.

<h2><a>Type-Directed Code Generation</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
At work recently I've been working on a library to get idiomatic gRPC support in
our Haskell project. I'm quite proud of how it's come out, and thought it'd make
a good topic for a blog post. The approach demonstrates several type-level
techniques that in my opinion are under-documented and exceptionally useful in
using the type-system to enforce external contracts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a>Elm Is Wrong</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider this post to be *what I wished I knew about Elm before deciding to
write code in it.* Since I can't send this information into the past and save
myself a few weeks of frustration, it's too late for me, but perhaps you, gentle
reader, can avoid this egregious tarpit of a language where abstraction goes to
die.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a>Modeling Music</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Music education usually comes in the form of "here are a bunch of facts about
music; memorize them and you will now know music." As someone who got good at
math because it was the only subject he could find that didn't require a lot of
memorization, this is a frustrating situation to be in for me. Music education,
in other words, presents too many theorems and too few axioms.

<h1 class="subheader"><a href="/{{canonical_url}}">Projects</a></h1>

<p>
I have a lot of spare time, which manifests itself in the form of chasing
whimsies as they take me. There's an <a>unending torrent</a> of new and
exciting (read: liable to break) projects on my plate, but some of the more
interesting and polished ones are:
</p>

<h2><a>Ecstasy</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
An entity-component-system for Haskell that's a joy to program against.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a>Constraints-Emerge</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
A GHC plugin that defers typeclass instance resolution until runtime.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a>How These Things Work</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
A textbook about programming from first principles that was written quickly.
